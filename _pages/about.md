Hi, welcome to my personal website! I am a scientist working at the intersection of physics and computer science with applications on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 

My work focuses onÂ investigating the advantages of the use of non-standard diffusion sequences for biophysical tissue models. My research interests are in the areas of diffusion in the brain, MRI biophysics, inverse problems, and machine learning for medical image analysis.
