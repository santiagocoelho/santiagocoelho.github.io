This is my personal website (under construction)


My work focuses onÂ investigating the advantages of the use of non-standard diffusion sequences for biophysical tissue models. My research interests are in the areas of diffusion in the brain, MRI biophysics, inverse problems, and Machine Learning for medical image analysis.
