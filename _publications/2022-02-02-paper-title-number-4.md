Here we find optimal multidimensional diffusion MRI protocols by minimizing the mean-squared error of machine learning-based SM parameter estimates for two 3T scanners with corresponding gradient strengths of 40 and 80 mT/m. We assess intra-scanner and inter-scanner repeatability for 15-minute optimal protocols by scanning 20 healthy volunteers twice on both scanners. The coefficients of variation all SM parametersexcept free water fraction are <10% voxelwise and 1 − 4% for their region-averaged values. As the achieved SM reproducibility outcomes are similar to those of conventional diffusion tensor imaging, our results enablerobust in vivo mapping of white matter microstructure in neuroscience research and in the clinic.
