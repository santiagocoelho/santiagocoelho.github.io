excerpt: 'This paper shows that incorporating double diffusion encoding (DDE) measurements help resolve the degeneracy in the parameter estimation for the Standard Model of diffusion in white matter for a Watson fiber distribution function (ODF). This is also the case for an arbitrary ODF, as was later proved.'

This paper shows that incorporating double diffusion encoding (DDE) measurements help resolve the degeneracy in the parameter estimation for the Standard Model of diffusion in white matter for a Watson fiber distribution function (ODF). This is also the case for an arbitrary ODF, as was later proved.
