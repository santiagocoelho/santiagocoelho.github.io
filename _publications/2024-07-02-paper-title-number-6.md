Biophysical modeling of diffusion MRI (dMRI) offers the exciting potential of bridging the gap between the macroscopic MRI resolution and microscopic cellular features, effectively turning the MRI scanner into a noninvasive in vivo microscope. In brain white matter, the Standard Model (SM) interprets the dMRI signal in terms of axon dispersion, intra- and extra-axonal water fractions, and diffusivities. However, for SM to be fully applicable and correctly interpreted, it needs to be carefully evaluated using histology. Here, we perform a comprehensive histological validation of the SM parameters, by characterizing white matter (WM) microstructure in sham and injured rat brains using volume electron microscopy and ex vivo dMRI. Sensitivity is evaluated by how well each SM metric correlates with its histological counterpart, and specificity by the lack of correlation with other, non-corresponding histological features. Compared to previously developed SM estimators with constraints, our results show that SMI is the most sensitive and specific. Furthermore, we derive the functional form of the fiber orientation distribution based on its exponentially decreasing rotational invariants. This comprehensive comparison with histology may facilitate the clinical adoption of in vivo dMRI-derived SM parameters as biomarkers for neurological disorders.
